# Requirements

## Introduction
* **Time Difference Calculator** is a script that can calculate the difference between two dates in different formats.

* It can specify how nany years, months and days have elapsed between two dates.

* This can effectively help calculate specific number of days or months left for completion of large projects.

* Time Difference Calculator is a tool that renders a helping hand by doing such convertions in few seconds.


## Cost and Features
### *Cost*
Since the system uses only open source software, it is free of cost..!!



### *Features*
The various features/options for interconversion of the system are:

# 4W&#39;s and 1&#39;H

## Who:

The tool can be a helping hand for people who are involved in management of large projects and want to know how many years or months or days left till the deadline of that project.

## What:

A Time Difference Calculator that takes two dates and tells number of years,months,or days between them in few seconds.

## When:

When people are struggling with calculation of specific number of months or days between two dates which are very far apart. 

## Where:

Can be put to use where simple or advanced scientific and mathematic calculations requiring conversions are involved.

## How:

The system opens up asking for the starting and ending dates. Upon entering the dates the user is asked for the format the user wants the difference.  The results for all these conversions are flashed in a second.
