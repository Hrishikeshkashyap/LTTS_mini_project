# Requirements

## Introduction
* **Time Difference Calculator** is a script that can calculate the difference between two dates in different formats.

* It can specify how nany years, months and days have elapsed between two dates.

* This can effectively help calculate specific number of days or months left for completion of large projects.

A Time Difference Calculator that takes two dates and tells number of years,months,or days between them in few seconds.

## When:

When people are struggling with calculation of specific number of months or days between two dates which are very far apart. 

## Where:

Can be put to use where simple or advanced scientific and mathematic calculations requiring conversions are involved.

## How:
